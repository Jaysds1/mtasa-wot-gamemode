# mtasa-wot-gamemode
An MTASA gamemode version of World Of Tanks!

WOT means World Of Tanks and this is the place where we're going to make WOT for MTASA as a gamemode.
MTA was lacking new gamemodes as we're all there looking at the same gamemodes in the server browser.

#About
World Of Tanks is a already known game made for PC and Xbox360, and I just thought that we should show how unique MTA is and display how similar it can be related to a real game. With this gamemode, we're going to be replicating everything as it is in the real WOT game. Obviously we're going to need the best mappers around and advance coders here.

#Why Open Source?
The only reason why I ended up opening this gamemode to the community/public is because I couldn't do it by myself and I was slowly losing interest in it, where as others might be more interested in it other than me.

#History
This gamemode was created before by me... but it ended up being lost as my old pc got damaged and all the files on it wasn't recoverable. Before that tragic accident, the server and the code was near completion and could've probably been out by now. After the accident, I was able to create the simple things I remembered about the gamemode, like the timer, spawns, etc... but as of right now, WOT has changed their game UI style and I simply couldn't keep up.
